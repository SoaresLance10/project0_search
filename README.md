# project0_search

This Project consists of a Front End that enables users to perform Google Search, Image Search and Google Advanced Search

It is writeten in HTML and consists of CSS styling so that the aesthetics of the pages resemble Googles own design as closely as possible.

The repository consists of 3 HTML files for each Page namely: Google Search(Index), Image Search(Image) and Google Advanced Search(Advance).

There are also two CSS files to stlye the pages.

There is one Folder to store any Images displayed on the pages.

Thankyou,Â
